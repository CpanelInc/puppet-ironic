    Fixes default configuration where only a single concurrent thread was
    permitted per WSGI worker process, which does not match the upstream
    configuration where threads are enabled per each spawned worker process.
    This allows for greater request concurrency to prevent situations where
    the webserver may incorrectly return a 500 error due to the server being
    unable to process the request in time.
