deprecations:
  - |
    The ``ironic::drivers::inspector::enabled`` parameter is now deprecated and
    has no effect. This option does not work with hardware types, and classic
    drivers have been removed. Use the ``enabled_inspect_interfaces`` parameter
    from ``ironic::drivers::hardware_interfaces`` instead.
